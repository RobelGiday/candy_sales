# Background and Overview
## Introduction
The US candy industry is a multi-billion dollar market consisting of a diverse range of products. This project aims to analyse a dataset of US Candy Distributor obtained from Maven Analytics to uncover the key trends, consumer preferences and opportunities for market growth.

## Objective
The primary objective of this analysis is to provide a detailed understanding of sales dynamics within the US candy market. This includes identifying the most popular candy types, and sales trends over four years. By achieving these objectives, we aim to offer the distributor actionable information to enhance their market position and priorities on candies customers love. 

### Scope
This analysis will encompass the following key areas:
1.	Factory analysis: analysis of the sales data across different factories to uncover each factory's profitability.
2.	Sales trends: examination of monthly, seasonal, and annual sales patterns to figure out peak periods and potential growth opportunities.
3.	Product performance: determine the best-selling candies.

The SQL queries utilised to clean, organise, and prepare raw data for the dashboard can be found here.

An interactive Power BI dashboard can be downloaded here.
